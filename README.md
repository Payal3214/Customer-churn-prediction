# Customer-churn-prediction
Customer churn prediction uses data analysis to identify customers likely to leave, allowing businesses to implement retention strategies and improve satisfaction.

This project measures why customers leave a telecom business. We will build a deep learning model to predict the churn and use precision, recall, and f1-score to measure the performance of our model.

Overview:-

The Customer Churn Rate Prediction project focuses on predicting whether customers will leave a telecommunications service provider. By using historical data and machine learning techniques, the project aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition, enabling businesses to take proactive steps to retain their customers and improve service offerings.


Problem Statement:-

Customer churn is a significant challenge for companies, especially in competitive industries like telecommunications. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn and understanding the reasons behind their decisions are crucial for developing targeted retention strategies and improving customer satisfaction.


Technology Used:-

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.

Pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries are used to create plots and charts that provide insights into the data and model performance.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used to implement and evaluate various predictive models.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Features are scaled and normalized to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are created to explore the relationships between features and churn. This step helps identify key attributes that influence customer retention, such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.

Model Selection: Several machine learning models are tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search and Cross-Validation optimize model parameters, ensuring the best possible performance and generalization to unseen data.

Model Evaluation: The chosen model is assessed using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score to ensure it accurately predicts churn and provides meaningful insights.


Benefits:-

Improved Customer Retention: By predicting churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, offering personalized incentives to at-risk customers.
Cost Savings: Retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, leading to reduced marketing and acquisition costs.
Enhanced Customer Experience: Insights gained from the model help businesses address customer pain points, improving overall satisfaction and loyalty.


Conclusion:-

The Customer Churn Rate Prediction project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges. By accurately predicting churn, companies can enhance their retention strategies, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. This project serves as a valuable tool for businesses seeking to maintain a competitive edge in their industry.
